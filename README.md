## Overview

ClarifyAI is an internal, role-aware question-answering system designed for organizations that maintain **controlled knowledge bases**. Employees can pose natural-language questions and receive **precise, citation-backed responses** derived exclusively from **sanctioned documents**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

The solution adopts a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern on AWS:

- Documents in **Amazon S3**
- Ingested by **Bedrock Knowledge Bases**
- Indexed into **S3 Vector Store Serverless**
- Answers generated by **Bedrock foundation models** via **Bedrock Flows**

A **React UI** hosted on **AWS Amplify** and secured with **Amazon Cognito** provides:

- Role-based access (Admin vs Employee)
- Simple query interface
- Low operational overhead

---

## Key Features

:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

- **Grounded responses with citations**  
  - Retrieves relevant passages before generation.  
  - Displays sources for transparency and auditability.

- **Role-based access (RBAC)**  
  - **Admins** can upload and sync documents.  
  - **Employees** can only query.  
  - UI adapts based on Cognito group.

- **Secure, low-ops stack**  
  - Cognito for authN/authZ.  
  - API Gateway + Lambda as a thin, auditable API layer.  
  - S3 Vector Store Serverless as cost-effective semantic index.  
  - Amplify Hosting for quick deployments.

- **Observability**  
  - CloudWatch logs for API & Lambda.  
  - Visible Knowledge Base Sync status in the Admin UI.

---

## Architecture Overview

ClarifyAI follows a **layered RAG architecture** that separates concerns for robustness and security: :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

1. **User Authentication & UI**  
   - Custom React app hosted on **Amplify**  
   - Uses **Cognito** for sign-in/sign-out  
   - Group-aware UI (Admin vs Employee)

2. **Secure API Endpoint**  
   - **API Gateway** fronting minimal **Lambda** functions  
   - Validates Cognito tokens with a Cognito authorizer  
   - Lambda orchestrates RAG with Bedrock and formats `{ text, citations[] }`

3. **RAG Engine (Retrieval & Generation)**  
   - **Bedrock Knowledge Base** ingests from S3  
   - Performs chunking & embeddings  
   - Stores vectors in **S3 Vector Store Serverless**  
   - **Bedrock Flow** wires KB retrieval + foundation model to produce answers

4. **Source of Truth & Vector Index**  
   - **Amazon S3** is the authoritative corpus (encrypted at rest)  
   - Uploads intentional and traceable  
   - Vector store used for k-NN semantic retrieval

> _See `docs/architecture.png` or `System Architecture` figure for the diagram._ :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

---

## System Implementation

ClarifyAI consists of:

- A **controlled content onboarding path** (Admin → S3 → KB Sync → Vector Store)
- A **secure query path** (User → Cognito → API Gateway → Lambda → Bedrock Flow) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

### Landing & Sign-In

- Landing page with ClarifyAI branding and options to sign in as **Admin** or **User**.  
- Sign-in uses **Cognito** (custom React UI + Hosted UI).  
- New users are verified and assigned to **Admins** or **Users** groups.

### Admin Workflow

> Securely managing the knowledge corpus. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  

1. **Authenticate & Upload**
   - Admin signs in via Amplify UI (Cognito).  
   - Identity Pool issues temporary IAM credentials with **S3 write access**.  
   - Admin uploads documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.) through the dashboard to an S3 bucket.

2. **Synchronize Knowledge Base**
   - Admin triggers **Sync** from the dashboard.  
   - Bedrock Knowledge Base crawls S3, chunks new documents, and generates embeddings (Titan).  

3. **Index Vectors**
   - Embeddings are written to **S3 Vector Store**.  
   - New content becomes available for queries.  
   - Admin fully controls when content becomes queryable.

### Employee Workflow

> Querying for trusted, verifiable insights. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

1. **Authenticate & Query**
   - Employee signs in via Amplify UI (Cognito).  
   - UI presents a simple query interface (no upload).  

2. **Secure API Call**
   - React app sends a POST request to **API Gateway** with Cognito ID token in `Authorization`.  
   - API Gateway validates token via Cognito Authorizer and invokes Lambda.

3. **Retrieve, Generate & Respond**
   - Lambda calls **Bedrock Flow**.  
   - Flow retrieves top-k chunks from **S3 Vector Store via KB**.  
   - Foundation model generates an answer.  
   - Response (text + citations) is returned to the UI.

## AWS Modules & Configurations

### Amplify-Hosted React UI

> Deployed frontend for Admin/User dashboards and Q&A. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

**Configuration (summary):**

- Connect React repo to **Amplify → Host Web App**.  
- Add env vars: Cognito IDs, API URL, KB/Flow IDs.  
- Configure SPA rewrites (`/*` → `/index.html`).  
- Deploy and verify the Amplify app URL.  
- Use `aws-exports.js` and `Amplify.configure(awsExports)` in React.

### Amazon Cognito (User Pool + Identity Pool)

> Auth, groups, and scoped AWS credentials. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

- User Pool for sign-in (email username).  
- App Client (no secret) for SPA.  
- Groups:
  - `Admins` – upload + query  
  - `Users` – query-only  
- Identity Pool mapping:
  - `Admins` → `CognitoAdminIAMRole` (S3 write)  
  - `Users` → default authenticated role  
- React configured with User Pool ID, App Client ID, Identity Pool ID.

> **Maintenance:** Whenever documents change or are added, re-sync the KB.  
> _Repeat: upload → Sync → quick test._

### Amazon API Gateway

> Front door for `/query` and `/upload`. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

- API Name: `ClarifyAIAPI` (us-east-1)  
- Routes:
  - `POST /query` → `RAGQueryFunction` (Lambda proxy, CognitoAuthorizer)  
  - `POST /upload` → `DocumentUploadHandler` (Lambda proxy, CognitoAuthorizer)  
- Example response contract:

```json
{
  "response": "The generated text answer from Bedrock Flow goes here.",
  "execution_id": "exec-123456789",
  "metadata": {
    "completion_reason": "SUCCESS"
  }
}
````

### AWS Lambda

> Backend logic for RAG queries and document uploads. 

**RAGQueryFunction**

* Runtime: Python 3.11/3.13
* Reads question from `event.body`.
* Invokes Bedrock Flow and returns:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "headers": { "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "...", "...": "..." },
  "body": "{\"response\": \"...\", \"execution_id\": \"...\", \"metadata\": {\"completion_reason\": \"SUCCESS\"}}"
}
```

**DocumentUploadHandler**

* Runtime: Python 3.13
* Env: `S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID`, `DATA_SOURCE_ID`
* Accepts base64 file content, writes to `documents/` in S3, and calls `start_ingestion_job` on the KB.
* Optionally lists existing documents via `list_objects_v2` + `head_object`.

### Bedrock Knowledge Base & S3 Vector Store

> Ingestion, chunking, embeddings, and semantic retrieval. 

**Knowledge Base core settings:**

* Name: `knowledge-base-clarifyai-s3vectorSt-6fino`
* RAG type: **Vector store**
* Data Source: S3 `documents/` prefix
* Chunking: fixed, 512 tokens
* Embeddings: Titan Text Embeddings V2 (1024-dim float vectors)
* Vector Store: Amazon S3 Vectors (Preview), index ARN stored in config.

**S3 Vector Store:**

* Vector Store Index ARN:
  `arn:aws:s3vectors:us-east-1:353833416570:bucket/bedrock-knowledge-base-r302k9/index/bedrock-knowledge-base-default-index`
* Data source object: `knowledge-base-clarifyai-s3vectorSt-gcbyn-data-source`

### Amazon S3

> Authoritative document corpus + KB artifacts. 

* Bucket: `clarifyai-kb-s3vector`
* Region: `us-east-1`
* Encryption: SSE-S3 + bucket key
* Public access: fully blocked
* Documents stored under `documents/` with metadata (filename, timestamp).
* Bucket policy grants limited `s3:PutObject` and `s3:GetObject` to specific IAM roles.

---

## Security & IAM

ClarifyAI answers policy-relevant questions, so access control is critical. 

* **Least privilege**

  * Dedicated roles for: Lambda, Bedrock Flows/KB, API logging, S3 ops.
* **Group-based access**

  * `Admin` vs `User` groups in Cognito drive UI and backend permissions.
* **Credential isolation**

  * Identity Pool grants temporary **S3 write** only to Admins.
* **API safeguards**

  * API Gateway Cognito authorizer validates tokens; unauthorized calls → 401/403.
* **Data protection**

  * S3 encryption at rest, TLS in transit, CloudTrail for audit logs.

> *See IAM roles table in the report for full list of roles and policies.*

## CI/CD via Amplify

ClarifyAI uses **Amplify Hosting** for build & deploy: 

1. **Git Commit & Push** – Developers push to `main` or feature branches.
2. **Amplify Build** – Runs install, test (optional), and React build.
3. **Deploy** – Ships to a CloudFront-backed domain with HTTPS.
4. **Rollback** – Previous deployments can be restored with zero downtime.

---

## Outcomes



* Built a functioning **RAG-based web application** with Admin upload + Employee query.
* Achieved **citation-backed answers** grounded only in S3-hosted documents.
* Demonstrated **secure, role-aware access** using Cognito + IAM.
* Reduced vector database cost by switching from OpenSearch to **S3 Vector Store Serverless**.

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

### Challenges

* Complex, cross-service IAM role design.
* Cost accumulation with always-on **OpenSearch Serverless**.
* End-to-end integration of Cognito → Amplify → API Gateway → Lambda → Bedrock.

### Key Lessons 

* Cloud projects require many small, precise IAM roles; permissions must be explicit for each interaction.
* S3 Vector Store is far more cost-effective for **cold RAG corpora** than persistent OpenSearch.
* Bedrock Flow provides a useful visual way to chain KB retrieval and prompts.
* Amplify significantly simplifies Cognito integration and token handling in React.

---

## Future Roadmap



* Automated KB Sync on S3 upload events.
* Multi-language support.
* Fine-grained, document-level permissions.
* Cost-anomaly detection and alerts.
* Richer analytics and search insights for admins.
* Integrations with Slack / Microsoft Teams.
